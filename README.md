# Harvard CS50 Course
This is CS50 2025

This repository is dedicated to my journey through [Harvard CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).  
Here you will find all the problem set solutions I have completed so far.  

Please note: these solutions are shared **only for educational and demonstrative purposes**.  
They are not meant to be copied directly for your submissions.  

## Project Structure
- Organized by **week**, **language**, and **exercise name**.  
- Each folder may contain its own `README.md` with additional details.
